## Introduction
In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bioinspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. The goal of the project is to look into a Paramecium(graphic) Genetic problem analogy and find the best solution to the problem.

## Background
We conducted GA program to find a good pattern of Conway's Game of life. The program will automatically generate differnet individuals and then do selection and mutation, finally we get a best pattern of GA program.

## Install
This program is developed by[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

## API

[Jenetics](http://jenetics.io/)

## Result

Please see it on report.
